            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am currently a student of Software Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University. 
                Currently I am searching for a placement where I can develop and adapt my skills to succeed in real-world situations. 
                I look forward to having the opportunity of a placement where I can gain experience of what it’s like to work professionally alongside like-minded people while learning in a comfortable environment. 
                <br><br>
                At the moment my interests lie in the development of web-based applications, especially enjoying the frontend part of things experimenting with using and comparing different frameworks. 
                While I do find backend development harder it does not deter my interest, and I try to focus on this part of the development process as a way to gain practical knowledge and skill. 
                <br><br>
                Away from university work I try to find the time to explore topics discussed in classes by researching them further to gain a better understanding and improve on what we learned. 
                At the moment I am working through LinkedIn’s online courses that have been made available to me by my university. 
                The course topics I have completed so far have ranged from UI/UX design to database languages, I try to both expand on what I have already learned as well as pursue whatever else takes my notice. 
                <br><br>
                In the future I would like to be a software engineer that focuses on web-based application development, though this is not set and I am open to any opportunities that pique my curiosity. 
                Recently I have been introduced to a project, that while well above my skill level still kept my attention when explained, that’s based on a Machine Learning model. 
                Before the project’s explanation I never thought ML would be something I entertained as an option but having heard of this project I find myself somewhat intrigued at the possibilities of such programs. 
                <br><br>
                I consider myself lucky to enjoy Art as a hobby, I believe it allows a different and creative perspective when writing code for various situations and to the problems that will likely arise. 
                It is probably why I prefer front-end development as I can easily visualise a design to implement as a UI. 
                I think this ability could be transferred to back-end development to assist with system design, database design, and data modelling. 
                <br><br>
                Thank you for taking the time to look at this portfolio. 
                My projects section will be updated as I progress through current projects and start new ones. 
                I welcome feedback, comments, and suggestions on my current projects or future ones. 
                <br><br>
                Sincerely, 
                <br>
                Thalia Evans
