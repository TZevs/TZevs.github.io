            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am currently a second year student of Software Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University. 
                Currently I am searching for a placement where I can develop and adapt my skills to apply in real-world situations and face the challenges that occur along the way. 
                I look forward to having an opportunity to gain experience in a workplace environment and the chance to contribute to projects used in day to day life. 
                <br><br>
                At the moment my interests lie in web-based application development and not just the technical aspect of the project. 
                I enjoy the challenges and possibilities that the backend provides that I, despite my near constant frustrations with it, appreciate the most. 
                I look forward to experimenting more with frontend technologies, specifically the frameworks and libraries, to create better interfaces and improve my code quality with. 
                <br><br>
                Away from university I research the topics discussed in classes to gain a better understanding and work to apply what I have learned in projects. 
                In my spare time I use LinkedIn Learning’s large library of courses to educate myself on topics that take my interest or ones I wish to make skill improvements on. 
                <br><br>
                In the future I would like to be a software engineer / developer, though I am undecided on which area I will focus on.                 
                <br><br>
                I consider myself lucky to enjoy Art as a hobby, I believe it allows a different creative perspective during development process and helps me understand complex situations better. 
                <br><br>
                Thank you for taking the time to look at this portfolio. 
                My projects section will be updated as I progress through current projects and start new ones. 
                I welcome feedback, comments, and suggestions on my current projects or future ones. 
                <br><br>
                Sincerely, 
                <br>

                    <p>Modules in my first year: Programming (2:1), Web Development (1st), Databases & System Modelling (1st), Software Projects (1st). 
                        <br><br>
                        I created web-based and console-based applications, both frontend and backend development. 
                        <br>
                        This includes a task management app, an EER calculator web-app, a currency transfer web-app, and a college website.  
                        <br><br>
                        The EER calculator web-app was a group project where I worked with 5 other people to meet a client’s requirements. 
                        This massively improved my collaborative skills, both with my team and the client, it taught me the importance of documentation and communication.

                        This course gave me a good basic understanding and foundation of different areas of IT due to the wide range of topics taught. Including:
